// base64 - Many systems (like JSON, HTML, or URLs) expect text, not raw binary. 
// So if you're working with binary data (like encrypted bytes), Base64 is used to convert it into a safe, 
// text-based format that can be stored or transmitted easily.


// Step	                                Description
// 1. Plaintext	                        Regular readable string (e.g. "Hello")
// 2. Encryption	                    Converts plaintext â†’ binary data
// 3. Base64 encoding	                Converts binary â†’ text-safe format
// 4. Output to user/system	            Looks like a string, but itâ€™s encrypted


// Encryption:
// Plain Text --(Key + IV)--> Encrypted Binary --(Base64)--> Encrypted String
//                  â¤· Combine IV with encrypted data

// Decryption:
// Encrypted String --(Split IV and Data)--> Binary Data --(Key + IV)--> Original Text

// ðŸ“š What are Streams?
// Imagine you have a really big fileâ€”let's say a video, or a huge text documentâ€”and you want to read or write it in a program. If you try to load the entire file into memory, it could crash your computer if the file is too big. This is where streams come in.
// Instead of loading the whole file into memory, streams let you handle the data piece by piece (in chunks), which is much more efficient and safe.

// ðŸ§  Key Concepts:
// Streams:
// Think of a stream as a conveyor belt that brings you small pieces of data (like chunks of a file) as it moves along.
// With streams, you donâ€™t have to wait for the entire file or data to load. You can start using it right away, piece by piece.

// Buffers:
// A buffer is like a temporary storage box where data chunks are stored as they come in.
// When a piece of data is ready, it's placed in the buffer. Then you can process it right away, without having to wait for the whole file.

// ðŸ§© Four Types of Streams in Node.js:
// Readable Streams (e.g., reading a file)
// Writable Streams (e.g., writing data to a file)
// Duplex Streams (both readable and writable)
// Transform Streams (change or modify data as it moves through)
